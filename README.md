# Francesco Palma
  
I am a Trainee Software Engineer who loves creating with technology.  
I am particularly passionate about **Front-End Web Development**, **Mobile & Responsive Design**, **Cross-Platform Development**.  
Before joining [CodeClan](http://codeclan.com) I had been working on the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript for a few months.  
Prior to that, I had some experience with WordPress and Photoshop.

# Francesco Palma | My CV & Portfolio 
  
I am a Trainee Software Engineer who loves creating with technology.  
I am particularly passionate about **Front-End**, **Responsive Design** & **Mobile Development**.  
Before joining [CodeClan](http://codeclan.com) I had been working on the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript for a few months.  
Prior to that, I had some experience with WordPress and Photoshop.
